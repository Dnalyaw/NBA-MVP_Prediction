# NBA-MVP_Prediction

As a student deeply interested in sports analytics, I wanted to find out how to predict who could be the MVP based on previous MVP data. Using RandomForest, I was able to predict the first 4 candidates in correct order this year

Looking at the accuracy and the feature importance, it is clear that points, field goals, and win/loss ratios are the most important when it comes to predicting the MVP, which makes sensse because the MVP is usually the player on the best team that makes the most shots. The prediction likely came out with Shai Gilgeous Alexander first due to this discrepency, as although Nikola Jokic was playing a stellar season, his team's wins pulled him down leading to him dropping to second on the leaderboard
